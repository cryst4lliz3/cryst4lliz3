## What is NGINX
NGINX is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

## Best Practises

### Hide NGINX version from Header

Generally, when a user requests an unavailable/broken link on an NGINX based website, then they get the following message.

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nginx/version-from-header.png)

As you can see, the NGINX server string contains server name and version. Attackers can use this information to hack your website. So it is important to hide NGINX server information from response.

Steps to do:

1. Open terminal and run the command below to open NGINX configuration file in a nano text editor.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

2. Add the following line to `http` block. 

```conf
http{
    ...
    server_tokens off;
    ...
}
```

3. Run the following command to check syntax of your updated config file.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If there are no errors, run the following command to restart NGINX server.

Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

Redhat/CentOS
```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```
